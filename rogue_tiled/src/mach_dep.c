 * to avoid triggering self-integrity checks.
 *
 * The probable workflow was this:
 *
 * - After executable was compiled it was test run using "The Grand Beeking" as
 *   the player name.
 *
 * - The "v" command (Version), when used with that player name, also prints
 *   the checksum computed by this function. See command()
 *
 * - The developer changed the #define CSUM value to match the one printed.
 *
 * - Code was compiled again, and only extern.c required rebuilding. It's not
 *   clear why the new value does not affect the computed checksum. Maybe it
 *   was based only on code segment.
 *
 * - On every new level except the first, checksum was computed again and
 *   checked against CSUM. If they didn't match, the PC was immediately halted.
 *   See new_level() and _halt()
 *
 * - This effectively prevents game from being played past level 1 with a
 *   tampered (most likely cracked) executable. Being checked on every new
 *   level also inhibits the use of debuggers to crack the game on-the-fly.
 *
 * - This check only happened if PROTECTED was #define'd, which also triggered
 *   several other copy protection and anti-tampering measures. See clock()
 *
 * To simulate original behavior in case of a tampered executable without
 * changing the source code, just compile with a different CSUM #defined

 * so it immediately breaks out without ever entering the loop. tick increment
 * is never checked, halt() is never executed. I'm not sure if this behavior

 *
 * Anyway, checking clock ticks with a busy loop is risky: the index is an int,
 * 16-bit in DOS, so it overflows to 0 after "only" 65536 iterations. Assuming
 * both i and j indexes start with 1, halt condition would happen after the
 * first outer loop cycle. And I think even in 1985 a PC could be fast enough
 * to execute such a simple inner loop 65536 times before the clock tick once.
 * 55ms is a long time, even for an 8MHz AT-286.
 *
 * So this could have been be deemed unsuitable as a check for enabled clocks,
 * dangerous as it could lead to a halt, and so it was intentionally disabled.
 *
 *       ... or it could be a bug.
 *
 * Now it pauses for half a tick (27ms), the average wait if intended behavior
 * was working, and tick the clock once only to unlock copy protection, as
 * tick is no longer used or extern'ed.
